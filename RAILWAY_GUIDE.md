## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- ✅ A GitHub account
- ✅ Your project pushed to a GitHub repository
- ✅ Node.js installed locally (for testing)
- ✅ Your frontend deployed (Vercel or other)

---

## Railway Account Setup

### Step 1: Create Railway Account

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"Start a New Project"** or **"Login"**
3. Sign up using one of these methods:
   - **GitHub** (Recommended - easiest integration)
   - Email
   - Google

### Step 2: Verify Your Account

- Check your email and verify your account if required
- Complete any onboarding steps Railway provides

---

## Project Preparation

### Step 1: Verify Your Project Structure

Your project should have this structure:
```
movie-website/
├── backend/
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── config/
├── frontend/
└── railway.json (we'll create this)
```

### Step 2: Check Backend package.json

Make sure your `backend/package.json` has:
- ✅ A `start` script: `"start": "node server.js"`
- ✅ All dependencies listed (express, axios, cors, dotenv, cheerio)

### Step 3: Create railway.json (Optional)

Railway can auto-detect Node.js projects. The `railway.json` file is optional and minimal:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

**⚠️ Important Notes:**
- **DO NOT include `cd backend` in commands** - Railway will use the Root Directory setting from the dashboard
- The most important configuration is setting **Root Directory to `backend`** in Railway dashboard Settings
- This file is optional - Railway will work fine without it if you configure Root Directory in the dashboard

---

## Deploying to Railway

### Method 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Create New Project

1. In Railway dashboard, click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub if prompted
4. Select your repository: `movie-website` (or your repo name)
5. Click **"Deploy Now"**

#### Step 2: Configure Service

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Railway will auto-detect your project, but you MUST configure the Root Directory:

1. **Click on your service** (it will be named after your repo)
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. **Scroll down to "Root Directory"** section
4. **Set Root Directory to:** `backend`
   - This is the MOST IMPORTANT setting!
   - This tells Railway to treat the `backend/` folder as the root of your app
   - Without this, Railway will try to build from the project root and fail

5. Configure the following commands (should auto-detect after setting root directory):

   **Start Command:**
   - Should auto-detect: `npm start`
   - If not, set it to: `npm start`
   - **DO NOT include `cd backend`** - Railway is already in the backend folder

   **Build Command:**
   - Should auto-detect: `npm install`
   - If not, set it to: `npm install`
   - **DO NOT include `cd backend`** - Railway is already in the backend folder

#### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

1. Go to the **Variables** tab in your service
2. Click **"New Variable"** and add each of these:

   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

   ```
   PORT=3000
   ```
   (Railway will automatically set PORT, but you can set it explicitly)

   ```
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
   ```
   Replace `your-frontend.vercel.app` with your actual Vercel frontend URL

   ```
   MOVIEBOX_API_HOST=https://h5.aoneroom.com
   ```

3. Click **"Add"** after each variable

#### Step 4: Deploy

1. Railway will automatically start building and deploying
2. Watch the **Deployments** tab to see the build progress
3. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

#### Step 5: Get Your Backend URL

1. Once deployed, go to the **Settings** tab
2. Scroll down to **"Domains"** section
3. Railway automatically generates a domain like: `your-service-name.up.railway.app`
4. **Copy this URL** - you'll need it for your frontend

**OR** you can create a custom domain:
- Click **"Generate Domain"** or **"Custom Domain"**
- Railway will give you a URL like: `movie-backend-production.up.railway.app`

---

### Method 2: Deploy via Railway CLI

If you prefer using the command line:

#### Step 1: Install Railway CLI

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

#### Step 2: Login

```bash
railway login
```

This will open your browser to authenticate.

#### Step 3: Initialize Project

```bash
cd backend
railway init
```

Follow the prompts to create a new project or link to existing.

#### Step 4: Set Environment Variables

```bash
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
railway variables set MOVIEBOX_API_HOST=https://h5.aoneroom.com
```

#### Step 5: Deploy

```bash
railway up
```

This will deploy your backend to Railway.

## Environment Variables Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Add these in Railway dashboard under **Variables** tab:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Environment mode |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Server port (Railway sets this automatically, but you can override) |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://your-frontend.vercel.app` | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins |
| `MOVIEBOX_API_HOST` | `https://h5.aoneroom.com` | Moviebox API host URL |

### Setting Multiple Origins

If you want to allow multiple origins (e.g., localhost for testing + production):

```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173
```

**Note:** Separate multiple origins with commas (no spaces).

---

## Connecting Frontend to Backend

### Step 1: Get Your Railway Backend URL

1. In Railway dashboard, go to your service
2. Go to **Settings** → **Domains**
3. Copy your Railway URL (e.g., `https://movie-backend-production.up.railway.app`)

### Step 2: Update Frontend Configuration

You have two options:

#### Option A: Update Frontend JavaScript Config

1. Open `frontend/js/config.js`
2. Update the API base URL:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app';
```

#### Option B: Use Environment Variable (Vercel)

1. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add:
   - **Name:** `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (or `API_BASE_URL`)
   - **Value:** `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app`
4. Redeploy your frontend

### Step 3: Update Backend CORS

1. In Railway dashboard, go to **Variables**
2. Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to include your frontend URL:
   ```
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
   ```
3. Railway will automatically redeploy with the new variable

### Step 4: Test the Connection

1. Visit your frontend URL
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab
3. Try searching for a movie
4. Check if API calls are going to your Railway backend
5. Look for any CORS errors in the console

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Build Fails - "can't cd to backend"

**Error:** `sh: 1: cd: can't cd to backend` or `ERROR: failed to build`

**Solutions:**
1. **Set Root Directory in Railway Dashboard:**
   - Go to your service → **Settings** tab
   - Scroll to **"Root Directory"** section
   - Set it to: `backend` (without quotes)
   - This is the most common cause of this error!

2. **Remove `cd backend` from commands:**
   - In **Settings** → **Start Command**, it should be: `npm start` (NOT `cd backend && npm start`)
   - In **Settings** → **Build Command**, it should be: `npm install` (NOT `cd backend && npm install`)
   - When Root Directory is set to `backend`, Railway is already in that folder

3. **Delete or simplify railway.json:**
   - If you have `railway.json` with `cd backend` commands, either delete it or simplify it
   - Railway will use dashboard settings if Root Directory is configured

### Issue 2: Build Fails - Other Errors

**Error:** `npm install` fails or build times out

**Solutions:**
- Check that `backend/package.json` has all dependencies
- Ensure Node.js version is compatible (Railway uses Node 18+ by default)
- Check build logs in Railway dashboard → **Deployments** tab

### Issue 3: Service Crashes on Start

**Error:** Service starts then immediately crashes

**Solutions:**
1. Check logs: Railway dashboard → **Deployments** → Click on latest deployment → **View Logs**
2. Common issues:
   - Missing environment variables
   - Port configuration (Railway sets PORT automatically, don't hardcode it)
   - Missing dependencies

### Issue 4: 403 "Invalid Region" Error

**Error:** Still getting 403 errors from Moviebox API

**Solutions:**
1. **Try different regions:**
   - Railway allows you to select deployment region
   - Go to **Settings** → **Region**
   - Try: US East, US West, or Europe regions

2. **Check API host:**
   - Try different mirror hosts in `MOVIEBOX_API_HOST`:
     - `https://movieboxapp.in`
     - `https://moviebox.pk`
     - `https://moviebox.ph`

### Issue 5: CORS Errors

**Error:** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` errors in browser

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes your exact frontend URL (with `https://`)
2. No trailing slashes in the URL
3. Check that Railway service is running (green status)
4. Restart the service: **Settings** → **Restart**

### Issue 6: Timeout Errors

**Error:** Requests timing out

**Solutions:**
- Railway free tier has some limits, but should handle normal API requests
- Check Railway dashboard for service status
- Verify your backend is responding: Visit `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health`

### Issue 7: Can't Find Backend Files

**Error:** Railway can't find `server.js` or `package.json`

**Solutions:**
1. Set **Root Directory** to `backend` in Railway settings
2. Or create `railway.json` in root with proper configuration
3. Ensure your files are committed to GitHub
